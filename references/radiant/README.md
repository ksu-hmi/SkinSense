Radiant is a skincare application where users can keep track of their skincare routines and skin progress. My vision for developing and designing Radiant was to create an easy to use application with a clean and minimal appearance. The range of skincare products and routines can be daunting for skincare newcomers, so I utilized a five step concept on Radiant to keep skincare simple and refreshing!

<!-- * Users can manually input their own products to be added to a routine(s).
* Users can check off products they've used in their routines and submit the routine for completion.
* When a user completes a routine, a journal entry is created to keep track of the user's skin condition and progress.
* Product information can be filtered and searched for to learn more about the ingredients and application process.-->
