# 📍 Project Roadmap – SkinSense

This roadmap tracks the key milestones and tasks for the development of **SkinSense** – a personal skincare tracker and ingredient guide designed to help users make more informed skincare decisions. The project spans 3 sprints.

---

## ✅ Sprint 1: Setup & Exploration

**Goals:**  
- Set up the project repo  
- Review related repositories  
- Begin outlining features and structure

### Tasks:
- [x] Fork and clone the `radiant` repository into the `ksu-hmi` GitHub organization
- [x] Upload core files from `radiant` to `references/radiant/` inside `SkinSense`
- [x] Evaluate the structure and code of the `radiant` repo
- [x] Create initial project folders: `routines/`, `ingredients/`, `images/`
- [x] Create and structure `README.md`
- [x] Assign open source license (MIT)
- [x] Set up `projectroadmap.md` with Sprint 1 tasks

### Exploration Notes:
- The `radiant` repo helped me understand how Streamlit can handle user input forms and layout.
- The [`skincare-routine-helper`](https://github.com/florating/skincare-routine-helper) repo provided additional ideas for how to organize skincare routine data, structure entries, and handle product information.
- Only essential files were included in my repo to keep things clean.
- Future interface layout ideas may be inspired by `radiant`'s form handling.
